This projects objective is to create a filter that can read in a signal from a power line, Filter it, phase shift where nessiscary and output the signal.
DAC, ADC, Buffers will be used throughout the process.

Issue caused by systemclock being 4Mhz not 80Mhz as expected which cahnged my frequency calculations, debugger was neeeded to realied and fix the issue

phase shift done using peteniometer to determine how leading or lagging the phase is

L432kc set to run at 80MHz or 12.5ns between executions, to take 50000 sample per second, a sample is taken every 1600 ticks 20us
To calculate frequency we take 1/(num_of_samples*time_per_sample)
