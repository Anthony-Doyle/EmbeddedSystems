This projects objective is to create a filter that can read in a signal from a power line, Filter it, phase shift where nessiscary and output the signal.
DAC, ADC, Buffers will be used throughout the process.

Using a Fir filter over a butterworth to avoid instability
40 orders neeed for the fir filter

A second buffer is used, buffer one stores data when reading in, the second stores data to allow the sinewave to be simulated

Issue caused by systemclock being 4Mhz not 80Mhz as expected which cahnged my frequency calculations, debugger was neeeded to realied and fix the issue
