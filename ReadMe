This projects objective is to create a filter that can read in a signal from a power line, Filter it, phase shift where nessiscary and output the signal.
DAC, ADC, Buffers will be used throughout the process.

Using a Fir filter over a butterworth to avoid instability
40 orders neeed for the fir filter

A second buffer is used, buffer one stores data when reading in, the second stores data to allow the sinewave to be simulated
